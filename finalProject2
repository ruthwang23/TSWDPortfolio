# Final Project Part II - Wireframes & User Research

## Starting storyboard & wireframes

## User research
### Protocol
My primary target audience is residents of Pittsburgh.  
A few secondary audiences are policy/decision-makers in Pittsburgh and residents and policy/decision-makers at the county and state levels.

_For the mean time, as I don't really know people in Pittsburgh beyond campus, I interviewed fellow graduate students.  
After our in-class feedback on Monday and some further revisions, I will make a post to my neighborhood's NextDoor page to ask for feedback.  
My neighbors seem generous enough to spend some time to offer their thoughts._
