### About Me
Hello, I'm a first year PPM Data Analytics student at Heinz. Looking forward to learning alongside and from you all!

Before Heinz, I spent about 1.5 years traveling and enjoying quality time with my family. We went on a National Parks road trip, hitting Carlsbad Caverns NP, Rocky Mountain NP, Flaming Gorge National Reservoir, Grand Teton NP (my personal favorite), and Yellowstone NP. Along the way, we passed through many National Forests and State Parks as well. If you haven't gotten the chance to yet, get out there and explore these amazing places!

Prior to setting off on these travel adventures, I graduated from the University of Michigan with a BBA. I'm here at Heinz to build upon the soft skills I gained at Michigan with harder technical skills and a more social good focus. In just my first mini, I've been learning a lot, and I'm excited to continue learning more.



### What I Hope to Learn
I was drawn to this course because of the emphasis not on tools for creating data visualizations but on the art of creating effective visuals and using storytelling techniques.

There have been many visualizations I encountered out in the wild that I simply skipped over because they seemed they would take too much time to comprehend. How can we create visualizations that both draw people in and provide them information that adds value to our message- whether it‚Äôs a report or an article or a presentation? I‚Äôm interested in learning how we can create an engaging and effective story arc using visualizations.

Additionally, it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve had any training in color theory or design, so I‚Äôm excited to get my hands dirty with this stuff once again. Wherever I land in the future, I feel that being able to create visualizations that help inform and convince will be an important skill to have, and I'm excited to start off with a good foundation through TSWD.
