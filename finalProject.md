# Part I
## Outline
For my final project, I would like to expand upon a story that I have been writing reports about for other classes - lead in soil, particularly in Allegheny County/Pittsburgh. The central story revolves around this:

<p align="center">
<b> <i> Pittsburgh children are at high risk for lead exposure through soil.
   </i> </b>  </p>

Topics I would like to cover in my story include:
*

###### My initial sketches show more detail about how I will tell the story.

The key takeaway I have in mind right now is this:

<p align="center">
<b> <i> As a part of the Pittsburgh community, I want the Allegheny County Health Department (and other relevant agencies) to take steps to address these issues quickly and effectively for the sake of public health and safety. I can help push this agenda by sharing this story so more people become aware of the issue and drive change.

## Initial sketches
* sketches that outline your initial thoughts for your final project
* clear enough to be understandable to someone that has little to no contextual background for your project.  Your sketches should mimic aspects of your outline, and build on the resounding message you want to make clear through your project.  Build in elements of your anticipated story structure for your project.  Your sketches themselves do not have to be visually correct / accurate and you may use whatever method makes the most sense to you (hand-drawn, digital, etc.). 

## Th\
The data I will use for this project comes from the [2017 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=american%20community%20survey&g=0500000US42003&table=S0101&tid=ACSST5Y2017.S0101&lastDisplayedRow=41&hidePreview=false).

A few notes
* I have not yet had the chance to select out the numbers and specific data I will use for my story, but the information I will be pulling includes the following:
   * Age and Sex
   * Income and Poverty
   * Total persons and Number of households
   * Occupancy and Mobility
   * (possibly) Educational attainment
* I will likely use data aggregated across the city of Pittsburgh, but also focus on a few neighborhoods/general areas that are of higher concern.
* A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first. 

## Method and medium
* document how you plan on completing your final project.  If you choose to do something significantly outside of the technologies we've introduced in this course, please talk to me first.  I'd like all final projects to be documented digitally, so if you create something using physical materials  or more immersive, you may need to also create a video recording of your story. 
* Your final project deliverable must be an interactive, stand-alone project (e.g. something you've created using Shorthand or another platform) that won't require a future employer clicking through yet another PowerPoint deck.
