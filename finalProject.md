# Final Project Part I - Project Proposal
## Outline
For my final project, I would like to expand upon a story that I have been writing reports about for other classes - lead in soil, particularly in Allegheny County/Pittsburgh. The central story revolves around this:

<p align="center">
<b> <i> Pittsburgh children are at high risk for lead exposure through soil.
   </i> </b>  </p>

Topics I would like to cover in my story include:
* Three factors that contribute to high lead levels in soil
    * Old homes and structures - lead in paint was not banned until 1978
    * Significant traffic (at least historically) - leaded gasoline was not completely banned until 1995
    * Past industry - in addition to lead-based production, other industries also emit(ted) lead pollution
* Allegheny County/Pittsburgh risks as a whole
* Specific neighborhoods that interventions should target/start with

###### My initial sketches show more detail about how I will tell the story.

The key takeaway I have in mind right now is this:

<p align="center">
<b> <i> As a part of the Pittsburgh community, I want the Allegheny County Health Department (and other relevant agencies) to take steps to address these issues quickly and effectively for the sake of public health and safety. I can help push this agenda by sharing this story so more people become aware of the issue and drive change.

## Initial sketches
* sketches that outline your initial thoughts for your final project
* clear enough to be understandable to someone that has little to no contextual background for your project.  Your sketches should mimic aspects of your outline, and build on the resounding message you want to make clear through your project.  Build in elements of your anticipated story structure for your project.  Your sketches themselves do not have to be visually correct / accurate and you may use whatever method makes the most sense to you (hand-drawn, digital, etc.). 

## The data
The data I will use for my project come from the [Allegheny County Lead Data website](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Programs/Special-Initiatives/Lead/Lead-in-Allegheny-County.aspx) as well as the [2017 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=american%20community%20survey&g=0500000US42003&table=S0101&tid=ACSST5Y2017.S0101&lastDisplayedRow=41&hidePreview=false).

The Lead Data includes information about children's tests returning EBLLs (elevated blood lead levels) at the census tract level, as well as the muni/neighborhood level. Depending on what I am able to cross reference with the ACS (likely census tracts), I will use that level of data for analysis and visualization. The existing visuals on the website generally have to do with tracking testing or EBLLs over time, but I will focus on geographic areas within as current a snapshot in time as possible.

For part of my story, I would like to re-evaluate and visualize the [Priority census tracts identified by the county](https://www.alleghenycounty.us/uploadedFiles/Allegheny_Home/Health_Department/Programs/Special_Initiatives/Lead/Priority-Areas-Description-by-Census-Tract.pdf). I have not yet had the chance to select out the numbers and specific data I will use for this part of the story, but I will likely pull the following from the aforementioned 2017 ACS:
   * Age
   * Income and Poverty
   * Total persons and Number of households
   * Occupancy and Mobility
   * Educational attainment

A question I have is whether I am allowed to embed an existing visualization (with credits of course) to support my story. Someone has created a great [EarthTime visualization of the age of housing structures in Allegheny County](https://earthtime.org/explore#waypoints=1rCiksJv4aXi1usI0_9zdl4v5vuOfiHgMRidiDPt1WfE.1073081657) that I would like to use. If I do not have to create my own version of this visual, I will have more time to focus on creating other visualizations and crafting my overall story.

## Method and medium
I would like to use Shorthand to build my story. Having explored several stories created in Shorthand, it appears to be a very powerful visual and verbal storytelling tool, and I would like to gain some experience working with it. While neither of these really include data visualizations, I was particularly compelled by the Shorthand techniques used in ["Killer Chemicals"](https://interactives.stuff.co.nz/2017/09/killer-chemicals/) and ["Rembrandt: Self-Portrait with Two Circles"](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/kenwood/history-stories-kenwood/rembrandt-self-portrait/). The former makes great use of images and videos, as well as formatting key quotes from interviews. The latter is very visually engaging and stimulating because of the moving images behind title cards. These are techniques I would like to try out and potentially incorporate in my final project, if appropriate.

For my data visualizations, I will use Tableau and Datawrapper as appropriate. I may use RawGraphs to generate quick draft visualizations, but I would like to use tools that I can customize more easily. If I feel I need to create any infographics for my story (probably as a beginning/ending summary), I will use [visme](https://www.visme.co/make-infographics/?vc=infographics&utm_term=tools%20for%20infographics&utm_campaign=Campaign+%232+Visme+Ads&utm_medium=ppc&utm_source=adwords&hsa_kw=tools%20for%20infographics&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-301067231238&hsa_acc=2405880186&hsa_ver=3&hsa_ad=352917602365&hsa_cam=123505013&hsa_grp=71136869956&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_mt=b&gclid=CjwKCAiA_MPuBRB5EiwAHTTvMQoXR7ztee4S34xmRfqxDcj6KfrsIkq5Re_HTCsAGABhl8L9n9d-KRoCcogQAvD_BwE). 

For color choices, I will make use of ColorBrewer and Coolors. Generally, I like starting with ColorBrewer to get a generalized color scheme I can use and then use Coolors to tweak it and play around with till I find something I like. I will also run accessibility checks on both my visualizations and stories and do my best to make them colorblind-safe. I found this great site where you can check the colors of a website through various colorblind filters called [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/designers/colorfilter/).

To complete my final project, I will go through the following process:
1. Isolate the data/numbers I need for my data visualizations
2. Update my initial sketches based on actual numbers and get user feedback
3. Generate my actual visualizations and get some more feedback
4. Create my Shorthand story, embedding my visualizations
5. Get feedback on my story and refine
