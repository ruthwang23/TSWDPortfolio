# Critique by Redesign

### The visualization in question
For this assignment, I decided to critique Figure 1 from  
["Will a Five-Minute Discussion Change Your Mind? A Countrywide Experiment on Voter Choice in France"](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/aer.20160524.compressed_421e1937-b6c3-46de-ab46-03c207264cf6.pdf)

I selected this visualization because there is valuable information contained for readers of the paper that are pretty difficult to extract from the current design. I came across this visualization quite serendipitously. As my study buddy was doing reading for their econometrics course, I caught a glimpse out of the corner of my eye. Out of curiosity, I asked them to share the article with me, and as soon as I stumbled across this visualization, I wanted to tackle the challenge of making it tell a more clear story.


### The critique process
#### Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf)
This is a great critique method for considering targeted audiences for visualizations. While many visualizations are, in the end, public because of our communication standards and forums in the digital age, the context of a visualization and the intended audience should hold priority. Few's Dataviz Effectiveness Profile helped me note the busyness and lack of clarity, as well as some repeated information in the visualization. 

First, I wanted to address the issue of color because this is a paper discussing politics. In America, reds and blues represent the two parties when it comes to politics - right and left, respectively. For the French parties, these colors are switched. Thus, I felt I needed to derive my own color scheme to avoid confusion.

Through my redesign, I also wanted to remove repeated information, such as the keys/legends and repeated labeling. Rating the visualization on a scale of 1-10 for various attributes was also quite helpful to narrow my focus on areas to redesign.


#### Wireframing
This was my wireframe for the redesign. I tried to simplify the labeling and voter turnout ratios for less visual clutter since th
