# Critique by Redesign

### The visualization in question
For this assignment, I decided to critique Figure 1 from  
["Will a Five-Minute Discussion Change Your Mind? A Countrywide Experiment on Voter Choice in France"](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/aer.20160524.compressed_421e1937-b6c3-46de-ab46-03c207264cf6.pdf)

I selected this visualization because there is valuable information contained for readers of the paper that are pretty difficult to extract from the current design. I came across this visualization quite serendipitously. As my study buddy was doing reading for their econometrics course, I caught a glimpse out of the corner of my eye. Out of curiosity, I asked them to share the article with me, and as soon as I stumbled across this visualization, I wanted to tackle the challenge of making it tell a more clear story.


### The critique process
#### Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf)

This is a great critique method for considering targeted audiences for visualizations. While many visualizations are, in the end, public because of our communication standards and forums in the digital age, the context of a visualization and the intended audience should hold priority. Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile helped me note the busyness and lack of clarity, as well as some repeated information in the visualization. 

First, I wanted to address the issue of color because this is a paper discussing politics. In America, reds and blues represent the two parties when it comes to politics - right and left, respectively. For the French parties, these colors are switched. Thus, I felt I needed to derive my own color scheme to avoid confusion.

Through my redesign, I also wanted to remove repeated information, such as the keys/legends and repeated labeling. Rating the visualization on a scale of 1-10 for various attributes was also quite helpful to narrow my focus on areas to redesign.


#### Wireframing
This was my wireframe for the redesign. I tried to simplify the labeling and voter turnout ratios for less visual clutter and chose a color scheme (ill-represented by my colored pencils) from ColorBrewer 2.0.

Both of the "readers" I discussed this wireframe with had a struggle understanding the visualization at first, as they lacked context. I realized that I should make the title more clear - "French Elections Discussed in This Paper" - so that even if the visualization was taken out of context, it should be easier to discern the story being told. Additionally, I was given feedback about my legend, as PS and UMP were undefined. However, given the context of the paper and the added detail in the title, I would perhaps would not include a spelling out of what each of those acronyms represent. One person also recommend adding percent labels to the bars for more detailed and clearer data. Thankfully, the colors were not confusing, as I believe they could have been had I kept the original colors.


#### Redesigning
I fell ill with a high fever and was subsequently unable to complete my redesign. However, the following is a verbal description of my final redesign, as well as key changes I would have made to my wireframe based on user feedback:
