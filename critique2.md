# Critique by Redesign

### The visualization in question
For this assignment, I decided to critique Figure 1 from  
["Will a Five-Minute Discussion Change Your Mind? A Countrywide Experiment on Voter Choice in France"](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/aer.20160524.compressed_421e1937-b6c3-46de-ab46-03c207264cf6.pdf)

a short paragraph on why you selected this particular data visualization


### The critique process
#### Stephen Few's [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf)
a few insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering a redesign, if anything


#### Wireframing
![Redesign Wireframe](/IMG_20191110_220249.jpg)
any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  If it led you to change anything about your data visualization's design, mention what that was.  


#### Redesigning
style tile?
what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently
