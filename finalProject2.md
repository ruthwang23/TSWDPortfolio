## User research
### Protocol
My primary target audience is adult residents of Pittsburgh. This includes everyone, from 1-year Master's students to 7th generation Yinzers. A few secondary audiences are policy/decision-makers in Pittsburgh and residents and policy/decision-makers at the county and state levels.

_For the mean time, as I don't really know people in Pittsburgh beyond campus, I interviewed fellow graduate students.  
After our in-class feedback on Monday and some further revisions, I will make a post to my neighborhood's NextDoor page to ask for feedback. My neighbors seem generous enough to spend some time to respond and offer their thoughts._

#### Goals & General questions that will help achieve those goals
__Evaluate storyline__ Does my order of information (my story arc) make sense to readers?  
__Clear call to action__ Do readers walk away with a solid idea of what they should do with the information I provide?  
__Easy-to-understand visualizations__ How long does it take readers to understand what is portrayed? What changes would help reduce cognitive burden on readers?

#### Interview script
* Thank you so much for helping me with this project!
* Here is a visual outline for my project - please take a moment to go through it and then let me know what you see.
  * What stands out to you? What did you like/dislike?
  * How do you feel after reading through this visual outline?
  * Is there anything that is confusing?
  * Could you walk me through the story that was told in the outline without looking at it?  
  This will help me understand if I am communicating things well.
* More generally, is there anything you wish you had seen or hope I change?
* Thank you so much for your feedback and insights - they are very helpful for me to see how I can improve this project. Thank you again!

### Interview findings
__Interview 1__

_Overall, liked the story - thought it had good flow that made sense. Got the main message that Pittsburgh children are at high risk for lead exposure through soil because of various historical factors. Didn't seem to really digest call to action/resources to access - simply came away from the story feeling concerned._

Suggested edits:
* Make wording on visuals more clear, e.g. OF Pittsburgh homes WERE built before 1978
* Use images of children for more personal feel
* Be clearer about the consequences if we don't address the issue now - How will this impact the children's future? (will be addressed in intro text about why lead is bad)

__Interview 2__

_Overall, got the story and order of information but felt that it was a bit melodramatic. Wanted more concrete data and proof that the city/county should put resources toward addressing lead in soil._

Suggested edits:
* Include information about lead levels in soil in Pittsburgh (if available)
* Add $ cost of not addressing the issue (children's health care, local economic burden, etc.) vs. $ cost of addressing it (possible program costs)
* Be a bit more pragmatic and not just use pathos appeals

__Interview 3__

_Overall, liked the story. Wanted to know more about each of the resources I will be linking. Felt concerned about children and health outcomes for adults too._

Suggested edits:
* Build out resolution - What more can be done? How to keep ourselves safe? Describe resources more.

## Revised storyboard/wireframe
__Key changes:__ 
* Add in _slight_ detail for sections where I will discuss health implications and $$.
* Use more vivid imagery.
* Built basic structure in Shorthand, but could only create up to 25 sections - will figure this out.

__Changes yet to be made:__
* Write out all the text.
* Create actual visualizations from data: % homes before 1978 infographic & # homes chart, lead emissions chart, # children testing high EBLLs, Pittsburgh neighborhoods of concern (and all the supplemental charts in "appendix")
* Find information about already tested soil lead levels in Pittsburgh?
* Flesh out resources and hopeful/positive ending.

__Concern areas/further questions:__
* How many visualizations are we supposed to create ourselves? How "complicated" should they be? Is my story too reliant on images rather than data viz?
* I had conceived of this project as more informational, but since we need a call to action, I added a "sign the letter" part - is this necessary?
* Is there a way around the 25 section limit in Shorthand? Do I need to be doing actual html coding to get around that?
