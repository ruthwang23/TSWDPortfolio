# Final Project Part II - Wireframes & User Research

## Starting storyboard & wireframes

## User research
### Protocol
My primary target audience is residents of Pittsburgh.  
A few secondary audiences are policy/decision-makers in Pittsburgh and residents and policy/decision-makers at the county and state levels.

__Goal__ Question I need answered

__Evaluate storyline__ Does my order of information (my story arc) make sense to readers?
__Clear call to action__ Do readers walk away with a solid idea of what they should do with the information I provide?
__Easy-to-understand visualizations__ How long does it take readers to understand what is portrayed? What changes would help reduce cognitive burden on readers?

_For the mean time, as I don't really know people in Pittsburgh beyond campus, I interviewed fellow graduate students.  
After our in-class feedback on Monday and some further revisions, I will make a post to my neighborhood's NextDoor page to ask for feedback. My neighbors seem generous enough to spend some time to respond and offer their thoughts._
