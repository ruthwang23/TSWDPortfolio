# Final Project Part II - Wireframes & User Research

## Starting storyboard & wireframes

## User research
### Protocol
My primary target audience is residents of Pittsburgh. A few secondary audiences are policy/decision-makers in Pittsburgh and residents and policy/decision-makers at the county and state levels.

#### Goals & General questions that will help achieve those goals
__Evaluate storyline__ Does my order of information (my story arc) make sense to readers?  
__Clear call to action__ Do readers walk away with a solid idea of what they should do with the information I provide?  
__Easy-to-understand visualizations__ How long does it take readers to understand what is portrayed? What changes would help reduce cognitive burden on readers?

_For the mean time, as I don't really know people in Pittsburgh beyond campus, I interviewed fellow graduate students.  
After our in-class feedback on Monday and some further revisions, I will make a post to my neighborhood's NextDoor page to ask for feedback. My neighbors seem generous enough to spend some time to respond and offer their thoughts._

#### Interview script
> Thank you so much for helping me with this project!
> Here is a visual outline for my project - please take a moment to go through it and then let me know what you see.
 > What stands out to you? What did you like/dislike?
 > How do you feel after reading through this visual outline?
 > Is there anything that is confusing?
 > Could you walk me through the story that was told in the outline without looking at it? This will help me understand if I am communicating things well.
> More generally, is there anything you wish you had seen or hope I change?
