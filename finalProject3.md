### Final data story
_The Shorthand story I created with full interactive Tableau visualizations can be found [here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/rgwang/index.html). It is also embedded at the end of this page._

#### On audience
The primary intended audience for my final data story is adult residents of Pittsburgh. Additionally, I would want this story to be shared with Pittsburgh/Allegheny County elected officials and decision-makers, perhaps even with those in power at the state level.

I have intentionally included vivid imagery that involves Pittsburgh for a base level pathos appeal.
