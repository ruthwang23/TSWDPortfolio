## Final data story

### On audience
The primary intended audience for my final data story is adult residents of Pittsburgh. Additionally, I would want this story to be shared with Pittsburgh/Allegheny County elected officials and decision-makers, perhaps even with those in power at the state level.

I have intentionally included vivid imagery that involves Pittsburgh for a base level pathos appeal. Additionally, photos of children and family life make for effective pathos appeals to adults, especially parents. In terms of a more "logos" appeal, I did my best to make my visualizations easy to understand, whether with labels/titles or highlighting certain elements of interest. 

Including a wealth of resources and information is something that often appeals to parents, who want to read and learn more about how to protect their children. As such, I included more than the information referenced in my story/data, as I have accrued a significant library of readings on the topics of lead, lead in soil, etc. However, I also wanted to make sure that my call to action was easy and simple and a point of focus. (Note: I did not write out the actual "letter to policy-makers", as it was a bit beyond the scope of this project and is something I hope to continue working on as I research and learn more about the issue of lead in Pittsburgh soil.)
#### Nota bene
I was not able to include several visualizations that I put a lot of time into (involving maps of Pittsburgh census tracts and risk factors for lead in soil), as I felt it complicated my story and message a bit too much, making it longer than necessary. However, I'd still appreciate getting eyes on some of this work that I spent so much effort on, so if you are interested, you can download my Tableau (Public) workbook [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/viz_15755193198630/median_income_vs_poverty_line?:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link).

### On design
#### Story structure
From an in-class discussion with classmates and getting their feedback, I decided to modify my story a bit further from the wireframes I had created. Mainly, I introduced the topic of lead by referencing the Flint water crisis, as most people would be familiar with the topic and it could serve as an effective hook. Additionally, rather than describe all the factors that contribute to lead in soil first then going through them one-by-one again in relation to Pittsburgh, I have combined those two sections for more cohesiveness and ease-of-comprehension, as well as concision.
#### Color choices
I decided to maintain my general idea from my wireframe of separating the problem/solution portions of my story using dark/light themes.  
For visualizations, I stuck to using reds to represent generally negative data. For my visualization of the Pittsburgh population highlighted for the years where leaded gasoline was used, I abstained from the red because population growth is not negative. Specifically, I used Steelers colors for my chart elements because they are relatively neutral - the black (#101820) does not show up well, but I felt it was okay because it is not the focus of my visualization. 
#### Dataviz decisions
For the first visualization of decades housing was built, I had wireframed this to be a bar chart. However, because I wanted to communicate the overwhelming percentage, I felt that the convention of a pie chart would help convey my message better. Additionally, I decided to use an image of Pittsburgh (CC) as the background to have a combined effect of the shocking statistic and data with a vivid reminder of what this looks like in real life.  
For the Pittsburgh population-leaded gasoline visualization, I decided not to take out the Pittsburgh share of U.S. population line as chart junk because it still seems to be relevant information.  
For the blood tests visualization, I had originally left out the axis label, as I felt the title covered the chart contents pretty well. However, based on some feedback, this was apparently confusing, so I included the "Number of children (<72 months)" back in. This also helps give more information about who is included in the group of "young children" that I mention in the title.
#### Lessons learned
From working on this project, I learned that it takes a lot of experimentation with different dataviz options and tools to create (hopefully) effective visualizations. I had to play around with different variables to display (e.g. counts vs. percentages) and formats through which to communicate meaningful information. Additionally, I now greatly value feedback (even if it still intimidates me), as the feedback I received at each stage of my project, whether from Professor Goranson or friends and family or classmates, was all very helpful for refining my work and identifying areas of improvement in my blind spots.
